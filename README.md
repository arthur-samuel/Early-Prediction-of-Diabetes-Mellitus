# Early Prediction of Diabetes Mellitus

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for the early prediction of Diabetes Mellitus, a chronic medical condition characterized by elevated blood sugar levels. By leveraging data-driven approaches, the goal is to provide a predictive tool that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes at an early stage.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Thorough data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for model training.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation and comparison of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods) to determine the most effective model for early diabetes prediction.

- **Feature Importance:** Exploration of the importance of different features in predicting diabetes, providing insights into the key indicators contributing to the predictive accuracy of the model.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
